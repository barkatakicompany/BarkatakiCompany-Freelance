            <h5> DELIVERY, RETURN & CANCELLATION</h5>
            <p>
              REPORTS: Customers are requested to exercise due discretion and
              care while ordering reports, because once the report has been
              allocated to an astrologer for processing, no refund requests will
              be entertained. However, if you wish to cancel an order for a
              report, you can do so within one hour of placing the order, in
              which case you will have to e-mail our customer care team at
              support@barkataki.com
              <br />
              Reports are delivered within 24 hours from the time the required
              inputs are provided by the user. Please check product page for
              exact delivery times.
              <br />
              The delivery time-frames displayed on our website are approximate,
              but we make every effort to strictly adhere to them. However,
              since these reports are personalized and manually prepared by our
              astrologers, sometimes human delays may become inevitable. Minor
              delays which are considered reasonable will not be treated as a
              basis for refunds. Also, refund requests for incorrect data
              provided by customers will not be entertained under any
              circumstances. You are therefore requested to double-check your
              data before providing it to us. Still, if you e-mail us at
              support@barkataki.com within an hour of ordering the report, we
              will consider making the appropriate changes.
